Welcome to the getting started section of this Pulumi course!

In this scenario, we're going to learn how to install Pulumi, as well as prepare to manage resources by logging in to the [Pulumi Backend](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/state/#pulumi-service-backend)

Before you begin, you'll need to [create an account](https://app.pulumi.com/) so go ahead and do that now!
